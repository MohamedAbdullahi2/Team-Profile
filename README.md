# Team-Profile
 
 
## Description of the project


The project you described is a software application that allows the user to create a team profile by answering questions in the terminal. The questions prompt the user for information such as the team member's name, role, email address, and other details. This information is then used to generate an HTML page that displays the team profile.

The application is developed using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, and makes use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure the code. This allows the application to be easily scalable and maintainable.

Furthermore, the project is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and is tested using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework. This helps to ensure that the application is functioning correctly and as intended.

Overall, this project provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for creating and managing team profiles. It can be used in a variety of settings, such as in a business or educational setting, where a team profile is required.
